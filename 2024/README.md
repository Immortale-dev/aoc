# Advent of Code 2024
C++ solutions for AOC 2024 event

## Build and Run
you can build solutions for each day using any c++ compiler version >= 14. And then just pipe your input to the input buffer.

***Example:***
```bash
cd d12
g++ -std=c++2b -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp
./a.exe < input.txt
```

Some of the problems are fun and you can print the result of execution by defining `PRINT` macro. You can easaly do it with
GNU compiler `-D` flag.

***Example:***
```bash
g++ -std=c++2b -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp -D PRINT
```

## Days
* ✅**Day 1:** Simple _constructive_ problem ;)
* ✅**Day 2:** Simpe _constructive_ problem, solved usign _brute force_ in `n^2` :P
* ✅**Day 3:** String parsing problem, _regex_ saved the day }:D
* ✅**Day 4:** Easy searching problem. Brute force did the job :]
* ✅**Day 5:** Great _graph_ problem! Solved using sorting algorithms ;P
* ✅**Day 6:** Classic AOC problem! Unfortunately _brute force_ still does the job :')
* ✅**Day 7:** Nice _bit masks_ problem ^.^
* ✅**Day 8:** Pretty easy almost _constructive_ problem -_-
* ✅**Day 9:** Pretty interestin problem that can still be solved with _brute force_ but I choose the hard way ]:)
* ✅**Day 10:** Easy _graph travel_ problem. Solved with _brute force_, but some optimisations could be done ;}
* ✅**Day 11:** A nice classic AOC problem! Solved using _dp_ :O
* ✅**Day 12:** Slightly tricky _dfs_ problem @:]
* ✅**Day 13:** Beautiful _math_ problem! So much fun solving it ?;)
* ✅**Day 14:** Another classic AOC problem. Requires _cluster finding_ skills, or just eyes. Absolutely love it :3
  * P.S. use `-D PRINT` when compiling to see the easter egg.
* ✅**Day 15:** Great _recursive_ problem! Had a lot of fun ^_^
  * P.S. use `-D PRINT` when compiling to see the final grid, or `-D ANIMATE` to see the full animation.
* ✅**Day 16:** A pretty problem for _bfs_ and _path finding_. Nice one for practive >:P
  * P.S. use `-D PRINT` when compiling to see the final grid.
* ✅**Day 17:** Another classic AOC problem. One of my favourite kind. But this time smart _brute force_ does the job =.=
* ✅**Day 18:** Pretty simple _path finding_ problem. Used _binary search_ optimization :|
* ✅**Day 19:** Classic _dp_ problem >.>
* ✅**Day 20:** Another _path finding_ problem X_X
* ✅**Day 21:** Great _dp_ problem ^/^
* ✅**Day 22:** Another great problem for _hashing_ L:)
* ✅**Day 23:** Great NP full problem! Lucky the input size is not very large };P
* ✅**Day 24:** Amazing _brute force_ problem! So muck fun \*.\*
