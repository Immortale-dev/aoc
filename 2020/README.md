# Advent of Code 2020
C++ solutions for AOC 2020 event

## Build and Run
you can build solutions for each day using any c++ compiler version at least 14. And then just pipe your input to the input buffer.

***Example:***
```bash
cd d12
g++ -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp
./a.exe < input.txt
```

## Days
* ✅**Day 1:** Simple _sum finding_ problem. Input pretty small, even brute force will work here.
* ✅**Day 2:** Simple _constructive_ problem. Harder to parse then to solve :P
* ✅**Day 3:** Simple _constructive_ problem.
* ✅**Day 4:** Simple _parsing string_ problem. Could be much better solved using **regex**.
* ✅**Day 5:** _Binary search constructive_ problem. The problem itself teach you to use BS :D
* ✅**Day 6:** Simple _constructive_ problem.
* ✅**Day 7:** _Tree traversal_ problem
* ✅**Day 8:** Simple _constructive_ at first part, and _brute force_ for second.
* ✅**Day 9:** _Constructive_ problem.
* ✅**Day 10:** First part is simple _constructive_, for the second part _dynamic programming_ problem.
* ✅**Day 11:** _Constructive_ problem. Would be better to say **cellular automata simulation** game.
* ✅**Day 12:** _Constructive_ problem.
* ✅**Day 13:** First part is simple _remainders finding_, and the second one is about **Chinese Remainders Theorem**. Pretty annoying problem...
* ✅**Day 14:** First part is simple _constructive_ + _bit masks_, and the second one... I solved using recursion... Be patience, second part could take up to 10 seconds :P
* ✅**Day 15:** Interesting problem, it requires some analysing to be made, but I solved both parts with _brute force_ :P
* ✅**Day 16:** _Constructive_ problem at first part, and simple _brute force_ for the second.
* ✅**Day 17:** _Cellular automata simulation_ game. **3D** for first part and **4D** for the second.
* ✅**Day 18:** Pretty hard _constructive_ problem. I believe it could easily solved by manipulating input data, but I used fair way with building operational parser for both parts that uses _recursion_.
* ✅**Day 19:** Looks like a simple _brute force_ problem using _recursion_, but this problem requires some basic analysing to not stuck for years with _brute forcing_ of second part.
* ✅**Day 20:** One of the most annoying problem. I spent half a day debugging it... Pretty hard problem that requires a lot of code to be written. I solved using _bit masks_ and _recursion_.
* ✅**Day 21:** Not that hard how it looks like. Solved using _hash tables_ and _brute force_.
* ✅**Day 22:** First part is simple _constructive_ problem that could be solved using queues, and the second part requires some caching optimisation to speed up the solving. **P.S.** Better to compile with **-O3**, so the solution finding takes couple of seconds. 
* ✅**Day 23:** Both parts are just for simple _list operations_. The only trick is to make a map to access list items by label in **O(1)**. Anyway second part could take couple of seconds to complete :P
* ✅**Day 24:** First part is a problem for _coordinating on hexagon grid_, and the second part is **cellular automata simulation** game on hexagon grid, lol
* ✅**Day 25:** First part it pretty simple constructive problem! And the second part is better to see by yourself :P
