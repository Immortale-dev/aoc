# Advent of Code 2023
C++ solutions for AOC 2023 event

## Build and Run
you can build solutions for each day using any c++ compiler version >= 14. And then just pipe your input to the input buffer.

***Example:***
```bash
cd d12
g++ -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp
./a.exe < input.txt
```

Some of the problems are fun and you can print the result of execution by defining `PRINT` macro. You can easaly do it with
GNU compiler `-D` flag.

***Example:***
```bash
g++ -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp -D PRINT
```

## Days
* ✅**Day 1:** Simple _constructive_ problem for any language but C++. Solved with hacks. :P
* ✅**Day 2:** Simple _constructive_ problem. Even parsing was not that bad :D
* ✅**Day 3:** Simple _constructive_ problem. Solved naivly :}
* ✅**Day 4:** Simple _dynamic programming_ problem :]
* ✅**Day 5:** Very nice problem on _ranges manipulation_ ^_*
* ✅**Day 6:** Interesting problem that can be solved by using quadratic equations, or binary search, but the limits are so low, that brute force does the work :')
* ✅**Day 7:** Pretty cool _sorting_/_wildcart_ problem! But feels more like constructive ;P
* ✅**Day 8:** Great problem for training your _dividers finding_ and _LCM_ skills ^.^
* ✅**Day 9:** Pretty easy problem. Very elegantly solved using _recursions_ ;]
* ✅**Day 10:** Very interesting problem for _BFS_ and a bit over complicated _point inside enclosed path_ algorithm problems :F
* ✅**Day 11:** Very easy but great problem! Solved _naivly_ with a bit of range finding optimization %)
* ✅**Day 12:** Awesome problem! First part is solved with _brute force_, so better co compile it with `-O2` flag. and second part for solved using _memoization_ algorithm :@
* ✅**Day 13:** Very easy _constructive_ problem. Feels like next day should be extreamly hard xD
* ✅**Day 14:** Good but pretty easy problem on _finding patterns_ in a sequence of values -_-
