# Advent of Code 2025
C++ solutions for AOC 2025 event

## Build and Run
you can build solutions for each day using any c++ compiler version >= c++20. And then just pipe your input to the input buffer.

***Example:***
```bash
cd d12
g++ -std=c++2b -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp
./a.exe < input.txt
```

Some of the problems are fun and you can print the result of execution by defining `PRINT` macro. You can easaly do it with
GNU compiler `-D` flag.

***Example:***
```bash
g++ -std=c++2b -o ./a.exe ./a.cpp -D PRINT
```

## Days
* ✅**Day 1:** Simple _brute force_/_constructive_ problem :)
* ✅**Day 2:** _brute force with optimizations_ problem >;)
* ✅**Day 3:** Pretty nice _DP_ problem ^.^
* ✅**Day 4:** Simple _graph traversal_ problem [:}
* ✅**Day 5:** Fun problem on _merging ranges_ :P
* ✅**Day 6:** Parsing hell _constructive_ problem T_T
* ✅**Day 7:** Another fun _DP_ problem! }:D
* ✅**Day 8:** Awesome _union find_ problem! Solving it was a pleasure! :']
* ✅**Day 9:** Fancy _geometry_ problem. Got me thinking :>
* ✅**Day 10:** First part is simple _bitmask_ problem, but the second one, is pretty hard _brute force_ with optimizations -.-
* ✅**Day 11:** A great _graph_/_dp_ problem! ;]
* ✅**Day 12:** The problem sounds very annoying, solved with cheaty solution 'v'
